        <h3>Why keep a diary?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, because three days at YC’s AI Startup School (AISUS) generated roughly the same amount of stimuli as an entire semester of university, just with less sleep and way more jokes about the movie <em>Her</em>.  
          Though conference recaps aren’t a common feature of most technical blogs like mine, I find they’re a great way to 1) record my own learning and 2) let others know what to expect. 
          I’d like to think they’re also entertaining, especially if you’re curious about what the biggest names in AI think about our impending techno-utopia / annihilation. Anyways.

        <h3>Day 0: Temporary Acts of Mathematical Vandalism</h3>
        <p><strong>12:00 PDT</strong></p>
        <p>
          After a 5am start at Boston-Logan, I landed at SFO and immediately found AISUS co-conspirators at the airport. Our group (me, a math PhD student, a startup employee, a drug-discovery researcher, a software engineer…) wandered over to Pier 39 to see the sea lions, after which the three of us with the least chill walked six miles along the beach up to the Golden Gate Bridge. Activities featured:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inscribing the Axiom of Choice on the Golden Gate Vista Point railing (we were having an intense debate over whether or not it’s true);</li>
          <li>An impromptu lesson in suspension bridge engineering (did you know that the bridge deck nearly cracked in 1951 and had to be redesigned?);</li>
          <li>Sunset drinks at a rooftop bar afterwards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 1: If I Hear One More Scarlett Johansson Joke…</h3>
        <p><strong>07:45</strong></p>
        <p>
          I arrived at Pier 48 feeling smugly early, and then proceeded to wait an hour in the registration line. The upside to this was that I met several new friends, plus had the first of roughly 85 conversations starting with “so what are you building?” (Building a PhD is apparently a passable answer if you can’t talk about your stealth agentic-AI-B2B-SaaS-on-the-blockchain).
        </p>
        <p><strong>09:30 — Morning keynotes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sam Altman</strong> (OpenAI) promised big things for GPT o4, emphasising humans in the loop and maintaining truthful, aligned AI. Fewer Elon jokes than expected; far more philosophizing about AI girlfriends than I wanted.</li>
          <li><strong>John Jumper</strong> (Google DeepMind / AlphaFold) gave my favorite talk of the day on AI for science. My favorite kind of startup people are scientists without ego, playing for the love of the game, and John Jumper is a fantastic example.</li>
          <li><strong>Jared Kaplan</strong> (Anthropic) spoke on AI alignment. My main takeaway: red-teaming LLMs into unethical behavior sounds like an absurdly fun job.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>13:00</strong> — Lunch with a friend from ETH Zurich. Missed most of the afternoon to finish my own experiments (deadlines wait for no keynote). Returned in time to catch half of <strong>Elon Musk’s</strong> talk: thousands of humanoid robots within a decade and a 20% chance of AGI annihilating humanity. An interesting prior, though data-sparse.</p>
        <p><strong>18:30</strong> — Skipped the official afterparties for a demo-day rehearsal at the HF0 founder house. Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An ‘elixir bar’ offering herbal concoctions to boost energy and creativity. I tried a kava latte: tongue-numbing, socially lubricating? Debatable.</li>
          <li>My first In-N-Out burger (verdict: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ , distressing my Californian friends).</li>
          <li>A brief stop at the Cluely afterparty which, apparently, was dissolved by law enforcement afterward.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Day 2: I Am Converted Back to Twitter</h3>
        <p><strong>Morning keynote highlights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Andrej Karpathy</strong> (ex-Tesla AI) gave my favorite talk of the weekend. I redownloaded X on the spot to follow him.</li>
          <li><strong>Satya Nadella</strong> (Microsoft) told us to get building yesterday, since opportunities would dry up in a few years. Cheery.</li>
          <li><strong>Chelsea Finn</strong> (Stanford Robotics) demoed her lab’s humanoid robots attempting (and failing) to fold laundry. I really enjoyed the snapshot of hardware/robotics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Took an extended lunch with Michigan friends to absorb some Vitamin D, chat, and nap on the grass by the pier. Returned for the Amazon AWS after-party at the Exploratorium, where every attendee got a large sum of AWS credits. Left with new experiments in mind and a better understanding of video compression courtesy of my tablemate, an incredibly intelligent guy with a talent for explaining math without paper.
        </p>
        <p>By 9pm, the conference was done. After 12 hours of sleep total in three days, so was I.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>People &gt;&gt; talks: conversations with friends and colleagues are the best reason to go to a conference.</li>
          <li>Safety is actually, despite what I thought, being centered. Alignment and truthfulness featured in nearly every talk, and while I went in wary of the progress-at-all-costs narrative around the tech industry, the majority of industry leaders really do seem to be worried about ethics.</li>
          <li>My AWS credits are burning a hole in my pocket: I’ve never been to a conference that invests so much in attendees. Time to design experiments worth the carbon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I left San Francisco at 4am the next day utterly sleep-deprived, but equipped with a branded tote bag, a new appreciation for folded shirts, and a better answer for the next time someone asks me, “So, what are you building?”
